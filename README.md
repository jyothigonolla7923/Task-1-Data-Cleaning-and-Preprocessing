## ðŸ§¼ Data Cleaning Workflow

### 1. Identify and Handle Missing Values

- Inspected all columns to locate missing or blank values.
- Filtered and reviewed affected rows.
- Decided whether to impute (fill), remove, or leave as-is depending on context and frequency.

---

### 2. Remove Duplicate Rows

- Checked for duplicate entries across key columns.
- Removed exact and near-duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.

---

### 3. Standardize Text Data

- Reviewed text-based fields such as gender, education level, and marital status.
- Ensured consistent formatting (e.g., capitalized names, unified labels like "Single" vs. "single").

---

### 4. Normalize Date Formats

- Converted all date columns to a consistent format.
- Ensured the dataset recognized them as valid date types (not plain text).

---

### 5. Clean and Rename Column Headers

- Simplified column names by removing spaces and special characters.
- Standardized headers using lowercase formatting with underscores (e.g., `Year_Birth` â†’ `year_birth`).

---

### 6. Verify and Correct Data Types

- Checked each columnâ€™s data type to ensure accuracy.
  - Numeric fields were recognized as numbers.
  - Dates as date objects.
  - Categorical variables as consistent text entries.
- Converted or corrected types where necessary to prepare for analysis.

---

### âœ… Final Outcome

After cleaning:
- The dataset is free of unnecessary duplicates and missing values.
- Categorical fields are consistent and standardized.
- Dates and numeric fields are properly formatted.
- Headers are clean and uniform for easier analysis.
